Hello!
This repository is used to upload my verilog practice. Inside of each folder is the written verilog code, the testbench code, and screenshot of the waveforms.
Some of the projects are pulled from HDLBits, the "Digital Design and Computer Architecture" book by Harris and Harris, and random inspiration.
